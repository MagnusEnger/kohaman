Remember to put these in by hand after the pages have been generated

* koha-rebuild-zebra

  -u: runs the process as USMARC rather than the default of MARCXML
  -f: does a reindex of the whole collection
  -...: anything else is passed directly to rebuild_zebra. This is useful in particular for -v. 

* koha-list

  Options:
   --enabled       only show instances that are enabled
   --email         only show instances that have email enabled
   --noemail       only show instances that do not have email enabled
   -h              this help

  The filtering options can be combined, and you probably want to do this
  (except --email and --noemail, that's just silly.)
